# Connecting Claude SDK to Github Repo

*2025-08-27, Wed*

Today I learned how to integrate the Claude AI assistant directly into a GitHub repository. By running the `/install-github-app` command in Claude, a repository admin can connect their account and set up the necessary secrets. This allows for a seamless workflow where you can summon Claude's help on issues and pull requests simply by mentioning @claude directly within GitHub. It's a powerful way to bring AI assistance right into your development process.
