# When an LLM Corrects Your Understanding

*2025-08-25, Mon*

Today, Gemini Pro told me:

    You don't need to push the image to Docker Hub for your co-developer to work on the code. 
     Hub is typically used for distributing a finished version of your application 
     (e.g., for deployment), not for collaborative development.

The format... You don't need to do `xyz` ... because `xyz` is only for `XYZ` tasks, but what you want is `ABC`.
I find these types of nudges very enlightening. It corrects my misconceptions.
