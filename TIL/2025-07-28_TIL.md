# Installed Playwright MCP

*2025-07-28, Sun*

After hearing about it in several YT videos, I finally installed `playwright` for CC today. Now, it will take photos of my apps in progress and improve itself!
Simow has some really neat `playwright mcp` commands here: https://til.simonwillison.net/claude-code/playwright-mcp-claude-code
