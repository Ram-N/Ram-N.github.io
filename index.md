### Who I Am

I'm a data scientist, trainer, educator, and curious technologist. 
This page is mostly for my "side projects" which I pursue diligently for months at a time, until I find another shiny spoon!

I am happy to share what I learn and building things that invite others to explore

### What I’m Creating

I work across code, visuals, and interactive tools — 
Many of my side projects live in their own GitHub repos or galleries.

### What I’m Reading & Learning

Reading books is an important part of my daily life — I read across genres and track my progress via Goodreads. 
I aim to read 30+ books a year. My shelf includes non-fiction, tech, history, some fiction and the occasional curveball. I am very fond of travel books. (See LitMap)
