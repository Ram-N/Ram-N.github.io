#### Data, Code, Curiosity

### Who I Am

I'm a data scientist, educator, and creative technologist exploring the space where logic meets imagination.  
By day, I design learning experiences for students and teach them about the future of AI.  
By night (and weekends), I dive into generative art, maps, word games, and knowledge tools.  

I care deeply about sharing what I learn and building things that invite others to explore â€” whether that's a visual, an idea, or a line of code.

### What Iâ€™m Creating

I build with Python, p5.js, and curiosity. My work spans visual art, education tools, and experimental games.

### What Iâ€™m Reading & Learning

Books are a big part of my life â€” I read across genres and track my progress via Goodreads.  
I aim to read 50+ books a year, and my shelf includes fiction, non-fiction, tech, history, and the occasional curveball.
