## About Me

I explore generative art through programming, creating visual experiences that blend mathematics, algorithms, and aesthetic intuition. 
When I'm not coding artistic creations, you'll find me immersed in books across various genres.

I believe in the power of open source and sharing knowledge - that's why I document my creative journey and make my code freely available.
