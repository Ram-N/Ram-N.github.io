- Strictly 21 minutes (1 minute was to warm up and find my bearings.)
- I was able to make 4 iterations in 20 minutes. (3 + one copying error on my part!)
- Each iteration gives me clear ideas on what to fix next! I am jotting some of those down as future enhancements.
- My script to archive/freeze existing versions is not as clean as I wish it would be. 
- This is also why I haven't pushed this project to GitHub yet. Though I really should.

## Current Features (as of June 29, 2025)

- Click-based **pivot point selection**.
- **Visual pivot circles** for guidance.
- **Live ghost preview** following mouse hover.
- **Animated chair rotation** to new position.
- **Accurate move counter**.
- **Persistent history trail** showing all past chair positions.
