1.  **Game Idea Generation & Brainstorming:**
    * **Prompt Idea:** "I want to create a simple web-based puzzle game for players aged 8-12. The game should involve [mention a theme, e.g., 'saving endangered animals' or 'exploring an ancient ruin']. Give me five unique game mechanics or puzzle types that fit this theme, along with a brief description of how each would work in a web browser."
    * **Why it's good:** This prompt encourages creative thinking, defines an audience and theme, and specifically asks for web-friendly mechanics, guiding the LLM towards practical suggestions.

2.  **Basic Game Logic & Flow Design:**
    * **Prompt Idea:** "Let's design the core gameplay loop for a text-based adventure game where the player needs to [mention a simple goal, e.g., 'find a hidden treasure' or 'escape a haunted house']. Describe the starting scenario, three key choices the player can make, and the immediate consequences of each choice. Also, suggest a simple win condition and a lose condition."
    * **Why it's good:** This helps users break down a game into its fundamental components (start, choices, consequences, win/lose), which is crucial for even the simplest games.

3.  **Simple Visual Asset Description & Inspiration:**
    * **Prompt Idea:** "Imagine a pixel art style for a side-scrolling platformer about a [mention a character, e.g., 'brave knight' or 'bouncing slime']. Describe three distinct visual elements for the game (e.g., player character, enemy, background tile) focusing on their color palette, general shape, and any defining features, suitable for a beginner artist to draw or find similar assets online."
    * **Why it's good:** This prompt helps users visualize their game, even without artistic skill. It focuses on descriptive language that can then be used to search for or generate visual assets.

4.  **Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript Structure for a Game Element:**
    * **Prompt Idea:** "I'm making a simple web game. Can you give me the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create a 'Start Game' button that, when clicked, changes its text to 'Loading...' and then disappears after 2 seconds? I need the code to be as straightforward as possible for someone new to web development."
    * **Why it's good:** This prompt directly asks for code, specifying the desired functionality and explicitly stating the user's beginner level, which encourages the LLM to provide clean, commented, and easy-to-understand code snippets.

5.  **Troubleshooting & Debugging (Simulated):**
    * **Prompt Idea:** "I have a JavaScript function in my web game that's supposed to increase the player's score by 10 when they click an enemy, but it's not working. Here's the code: [Paste a simplified, intentionally flawed code snippet, e.g., missing `+=` or incorrect event listener]. What are some common reasons this might not be working, and how can I fix it?"
    * **Why it's good:** This teaches students how to use LLMs for debugging. Even without a real bug, presenting a simulated one shows them the process of describing a problem and providing relevant code for analysis.

6.  **Adding Interactivity & User Feedback:**
    * **Prompt Idea:** "How can I make my web game more engaging for the player? Give me three simple ideas for adding interactivity or feedback, like showing a 'Game Over' message, playing a sound effect when a specific action happens, or visually indicating when a player collects an item. For each idea, suggest what web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) would be primarily involved."
    * **Why it's good:** This moves beyond core mechanics to user experience. It encourages thinking about how players interact with the game and how the game responds, while also hinting at the relevant technologies.
