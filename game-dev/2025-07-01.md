## PivotMaster - V5 Coding Session Summary (July 1, 2025)

* **Created a new Git branch:** Started working in a dedicated `V5` branch for clean version control and later tagging.

* **Side Panel Styling Overhaul:**

  * Made the side panel stretch vertically to align with the canvas and analytics panel height.
  * Improved layout and typography (bold fonts, better radio button alignment, monochrome theme).
  * Redesigned the "Start Level" button to look more modern and prominent.

* **Analytics Panel Enhancements:**

  * Added a live **"Distance to Target"** display showing the distance between the current square center and target center.
  * Kept typography consistent with bold and large fonts.

* **Target Square Visual Redesign:**

  * Changed the target outline to a **dotted black border**.
  * Changed target corner dots from red to **gray**, for better visual consistency.

* **General Font and UI Cleanup:**

  * Unified fonts across both panels to match the clean bold style used in the analytics panel.

* **Final Git Steps:**

  * Committed all changes to the `V5` branch.
  * Tagged the state as `V5`.
  * Merged `V5` back into `main` to update GitHub Pages.
