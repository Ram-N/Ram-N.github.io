## Purpose

I’ve decided to use this workshop on **game design / game development** as a live test case.
This Markdown document will serve as a **diary** or **development blog**, tracking my progress from **concept** to (hopefully) a **functioning game prototype**.

Since I won’t have time to work on this daily, I’ll return to it periodically. This log will help me document:

* What has been done
* Ideas and design notes
* To-dos and next steps
* ReadMe-style explanations for future reference

---

## Initial Design Philosophy

**First Rule:**

> *Whatever a game is, I should be able to explain it verbally to a friend or colleague in 1–2 paragraphs.*

---

## First Game Concept: *Zen Pivot*

Inspired by **Krishna's idea**, here’s the high-level description:

* **Visual Perspective:**
  Top-down 2D view (everything seen from above).

* **Setting:**
  A **large rectangular garden**.
  Imagine space enough to fit **100–200 chairs**, but we’re only interested in **one specific chair**.

* **The Chair:**
  A **single, heavy iron chair** with **four distinct corners (legs)**.

* **Core Mechanic:**
  The chair can’t just slide or lift.
  It must **pivot around one of its legs (corners)**.
  You pick a leg, swing the chair around that pivot point, and repeat until the chair ends up in a **target location and orientation**.

* **Objective:**
  Move the chair from its **starting position** to a **goal position and orientation**,
  using the **fewest possible moves (swings / pivots)**.

* **Gameplay Focus:**
  Puzzle-solving, spatial reasoning, efficiency of movement.

---

## Next Steps / Immediate Thoughts

* **Clarify Movement Rules:**

  * Can the player choose any corner to pivot at each step?
  * Is there a limit on direction (clockwise / counterclockwise)?
  * Are obstacles allowed?

* **Decide on Development Platform:**

  * HTML Canvas?
  * Unity?
  * Pygame?
  * Godot?

* **Mockup / Sketch:**
  Quick paper or digital sketch showing the chair, the garden, and how the chair would rotate.

* **Basic Prototype Idea:**
  Start with a simple **grid-based representation**,
  before moving to smoother, physics-based animations (if needed).

* **To-Do:**

  * [ ] Write game rule summary
  * [ ] Create first mockup
  * [ ] Choose development platform
  * [ ] Set up basic project repo




## Next Step: Define the MVP (Minimum Viable Game / MVG)

### Goal

Create the **simplest working version** of the game that captures the **core mechanic**.

---

### MVP Features

* **Top-down View:**
  Display the **garden** and the **chair** (as a square with four visible corners).

* **User Interaction - Step 1:**
  Allow the user to **click on any one corner (leg) of the chair**.

* **Visual Feedback:**
  Once a corner is selected, draw **three light gray concentric circles** around the chosen corner.
  Each circle represents a possible **360-degree rotation path** for one of the chair's other three legs (if it were to swing around the selected corner).

* **User Interaction - Step 2:**
  Allow the user to **click any point along any of these three circles**.

* **Action:**
  On click, **rotate (pivot) the chair** so that the clicked point determines the new location of the corresponding leg.
  The entire chair pivots around the selected corner.

* **Tracking Progress:**
  Increment the **move counter by 1** after each pivot.

---

### Summary

This MVP focuses purely on:

* **Choosing a pivot leg**
* **Visualizing possible rotation paths**
* **Allowing rotation based on user input**
* **Tracking number of moves**

Future steps (like win condition, obstacles, level design) can be added later.

## Clarifying the Game Components and LLM Prompt Strategy

### Reflection Before Building the MVG

Before jumping into building the **Minimum Viable Game (MVG)**, two important planning steps need attention:

1. **Clearly define the core game components and mechanics.**
2. **Craft an effective prompt for the LLM (e.g., Claude) to help with coding.**

---

### Core Components of the Pivot Game

* **Rendering:**
  Draw and display essential game objects (e.g., garden, chair, corners).

* **User Interaction:**
  Enable **click-based selection** (choosing a pivot corner and target point).

* **Movement Logic:**
  Rotate (pivot) the chair according to user input.

* **State Tracking:**
  Keep track of **number of moves** and **current position/orientation**.

* **Game Progression:**
  Handle **game flow**:

  * Initiation
  * Progression (user actions and system response)
  * Termination (when win condition is met)

* **Reset and Restart:**
  Allow resetting the game for replay.

* **Optional Extras (for later):**

  * Analytics
  * Scoring
  * Move optimization stats

---

### Generalized Game Design Flow (Applicable to Many Games)

1. **Initiation:** Start the game, set initial state.
2. **Game Mechanics / Progression:** Core interaction loop.
3. **Termination Condition:** Check for win/lose/end state.
4. **Analytics / Scoring (optional).**

---

### LLM Prompt Planning

**Objective:**
Get help from an LLM (e.g., Claude) to **code the MVP/MVG in vanilla JavaScript + HTML + CSS**, keeping it simple and beginner-friendly.

**Prompt Content Ideas:**

* **Game Description:**
  Start with a **clear, human-readable description** (as if explaining to a friend).

* **Coding Request:**
  Ask the LLM:

> *"Help me build a simple web-based game with no frameworks. Use plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS."*

* **Guidance Style:**
  Request a **collaborative, question-driven approach**, where the LLM can ask clarifying questions before generating code.

* **Simplicity Focus:**
  Explicitly state:

> *"Keep it simple. Avoid overengineering. Start with the smallest working version."*

* **Flexibility:**
  Be open to suggestions from the LLM on how to scope the MVG, but also ready to **impose your own constraints** if needed.

* **Game Mechanics First:**
  Ensure the LLM helps you **nail down the key game mechanics** before writing any code.

---

### Summary Thought

This phase is about **thinking clearly**, **defining mechanics**, and **framing the right LLM prompt** so that the coding process stays focused and manageable.

---

## Diary Entry: Current Thinking (June 26, 2025)

At this point, I’m reflecting on next steps and feeling a bit undecided:

* **Planning vs. Action:**
  I’m wondering if I need to do **more planning**, or if it’s time to **just start building**.

* **LLM Collaboration Option:**
  It’s tempting to go to an LLM now and have a **back-and-forth discussion** to:

  * Refine the game idea
  * Let the LLM suggest improvements
    However, I need to **stay disciplined**:

> *Capture great LLM ideas in a "parking lot", but keep pushing for the minimum viable version first.*

* **Imposing Scope Control:**
  While LLMs are great at creative expansions, I’ll need to **impose my will** and repeatedly ask:

> *"What is the absolute minimum I need to build right now?"*

* **Coding Readiness:**
  I’m also mentally ready to **open GitHub**, **create a repo**, and start coding.

* **Technical Starting Point:**
  My target for the first build is simple:

* Start with a **square representing the chair**

* Implement logic to **move it to a new location**

* Apply the **pivot rules**

* Allow **multiple moves in sequence** (no win condition yet)

* **Mindset Check:**
  I may be missing steps, but this seems like a **viable and actionable starting point** for now.



## Importance of Clear Terminology

**Reflection:**
In past projects like **ClueChain**, having a **clear, consistent set of terms** for different game elements helped **organize my thinking** and **communicate effectively with LLMs**.

---

### Example from ClueChain:

* **Paragraph Box:** Main text or story section
* **Marketplace:** Area where possible options or clues are displayed
* **Clue Box:** Area showing selected clues
* **Game Score Box:** Displays user progress, score, or steps taken

This mental layout helped **structure the screen design** and guide **LLM prompts** for coding.

---

### Emerging Terminology for Pivot Game:

To maintain clarity while discussing and coding the Pivot Game, here are some terms I’m starting to settle on:

* **Chair Position:**
  Current location and orientation of the chair.

* **Pivot Leg:**
  The chair corner chosen as the rotation point.

* **Current Center:**
  The pivot point (coordinates) being used for the current move.

* **New Center / Target Position:**
  The clicked point along the rotation path where the chair should move next.

* **Pivot Rule:**
  The logic that defines how the chair swings from **current position** to **new position**.

* **One Step / One Move:**
  A single action where the chair pivots and the move counter increments.

* **Direction of Travel:**
  Optional visual indicator of the chair’s rotation direction or movement vector.

---

### Why This Matters

* Helps **organize UI layout** and **game logic flow**.
* Enables **clear communication with LLMs** during coding sessions.
* Useful for **future documentation, slide decks, and ReadMe files**.

---

**Next Action:**
Start maintaining a **Terminology Glossary** as part of the project documentation.

## Early Thoughts on Game Layout (ZenPivot)

### Activity Suggestion: Paper Sketch

As part of the workshop, we’ll provide a **sheet of paper and a thick black marker**.
Participants will be encouraged to **sketch out their game layout by hand**.

**Reasoning:**
Even though it’s early, **visualizing layout now** helps clarify the game’s structure and user interface.

---

### Web vs. Mobile Decision

For now, we’ll focus on building a **web-based game**, not a mobile app.

---

### Core UI Components for ZenPivot (Initial MVP Layout)

Here are the **essential areas** we need on the screen:

1. **Main Game Area:**
   Where the **game action happens**.
   This is where the **chair** will appear and **player makes moves** by selecting pivot points.

2. **Score Box:**
   Tracks the **number of moves** made so far.
   Optional future ideas:

   * Display **distance to target**
   * Show **move efficiency benchmarks** (e.g., *"Genius if completed in 7 moves or less"*)

3. **Help / Rules Button:**
   A **question mark icon or button**,
   clickable to display **basic rules or instructions**.

---

### Optional Future Enhancements (for later stages)

* Obstacles in the garden
* Irregular lawn shapes
* Dynamic difficulty targets
* Challenge scoring (e.g., move limits for gold/silver/bronze rankings)

---

### Summary

For the initial build:
**Keep it simple. Focus on:**

* **Main Game Area**
* **Score Box**
* **Rules Button**

This minimal layout is enough for the first playable version.

---

## Micro-Interaction Idea: Real-Time Chair Outline Preview

### Concept

Introduce a **dynamic visual feedback** feature during user interaction:

* As the user **moves their cursor (mouse hover)** along the **possible rotation paths (the concentric circles)**,
  **an outline of the chair’s potential new position** is displayed **in real time**.

---

### User Flow

1. **User selects a pivot leg.**
2. **Concentric circles** appear, indicating possible rotation paths.
3. As the user **moves the cursor** along these paths:

   * **A transparent or outlined version of the chair** appears at the corresponding rotated position.
4. If the user is happy with the preview, they can **click the desired spot** to **confirm the move**.

---

### Benefits

* Provides **intuitive visual feedback**.
* Helps users **visualize the move** before committing.
* Makes the interaction feel more **responsive** and **engaging**.

---

### Technical Note (for future implementation)

* Could be implemented using **CSS transforms** or **Canvas drawing**, depending on chosen tech stack.
* Use a **distinct color or dashed outline** for the preview to differentiate it from the actual chair position.

---

**Conclusion:**
This is a **small but impactful micro-interaction** that can significantly improve **user experience and control**.
