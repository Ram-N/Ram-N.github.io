# The 4-in-21 Pomodoro: A Fast, Focused Coding Rhythm for AI-Assisted Development

The classic Pomodoro Technique is well-known among developers: 25 minutes of focused work followed by a short break. But for AI-assisted coding—especially when jumping between projects or relying on LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude—a small adjustment can make a big difference. Enter the **4-in-21 Pomodoro**, a method designed for fast progress, LLM-driven iteration, and better mental pacing.

## Why 21 Minutes?

The choice of **21 minutes** is intentional. The first minute serves as a **warm-up phase**:

- Open the code editor (like VS Code).
- Glance at recent notes (for example, in Obsidian).
- Re-run any existing code if needed to re-establish context.

This quick ramp-up prevents wasted time and reduces friction when switching projects.

## The "4" Part: LLM Round-Trips

The goal during each 21-minute Pomodoro is to complete **up to four LLM round-trips**. A single round-trip typically includes:

- Sending a focused coding task, question, or next-step clarification to an LLM agent.
- Receiving a full file or function-level code suggestion.
- Integrating the code, running tests, and checking outcomes.
- Providing quick feedback to the LLM to refine or proceed further.

Working with LLMs this way rewards **smaller, well-scoped requests**. To avoid wasting time, it's helpful to keep project files **modular and compact**. Large, monolithic code files often slow down the process of both review and integration.

To speed things up further, **voice-to-text tools** can help when giving feedback or instructions to LLMs. However, receiving replies as text (rather than voice) is generally more efficient for review and copy-pasting code.

## Closing the Loop: Documenting Progress

A critical final step before ending the Pomodoro is to **document the session**. This means asking the LLM to produce two things:

- A **`changelog.md`** summarizing the changes made during the session.
- A **`todo.md`** outlining pending tasks, next steps, or unresolved issues.

These two artifacts create a clear trail for picking up work later, whether in the next Pomodoro or the following day.

## Managing Context and Energy

For developers juggling multiple projects, the 4-in-21 method allows for **controlled context switching** without mental overload. Working on **two, sometimes three projects per day** is often the sweet spot. This keeps things interesting while avoiding fatigue from focusing too long on a single task.

By embedding short bursts of intense, LLM-assisted coding within a tightly controlled timebox, the 4-in-21 Pomodoro fosters both **momentum** and **sustainability** across coding projects.
