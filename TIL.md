# Today I Learned
Just an assortment of (mostly) Tech-related things I learn, figure out or try for the first time. Sometimes, it is just to admire something!


### Installed playwright mcp
(2025-07-28)
- After hearing about it in several YT videos, I finally installed `playwright` for CC today. Now, it will take photos of my apps in progress and improve itself!

### LLM with Open Weights
- For the first time ever, I managed to install an LLM with "open weights" (DistilBERT) and take a look at its parameters! I am hoping to make a video on what I'm finding.

#### Claude Code's ability to test Python

- I am in awe of how quickly CC tests its code changes on the CLI. Bash is its strong suit.
It will often ">> run python; import abc from def" to see if the exports are working fine. So much faster than opening and IDE!
